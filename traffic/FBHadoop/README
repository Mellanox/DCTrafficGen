This traffic is FaceBook description of their Hadoop clusters [1].

Due to the locality distribution the user should instantiate at lease 2 data 
centers with at least 2 cluster each and at least 2 racks each cluster and at
least 2 hosts per rack.

There is just 1 role modeled for hadoop nodes (questionable).

The application model contain distributions:
* locality 
* msg size distibution for all localities

The application model contain parameters:
* interArrival 
* flowSize
* flowDuration_IntraRack
* flowDuration_all
