This traffic is FaceBook description of their Front End clusters [1].
We model only the Web servers and Cache servers. 

Due to the locality distribution the user should instantiate at lease 2 data 
centers with at least 2 cluster each and at least 2 racks each cluster and at
least 2 hosts per rack.

We have defined 2 Roles: Cache and Web.

The application model contain for each Role the following distributions:
* locality 
* msg size distibution, Should have been per locality but the paper does
  not provide it. We use the intra cluster provided by the paper for all.
* flow duration - different one per locality type
* flow size - different one per locality type

The application model contain parameters:
* cache_interArrival 
* web_interArrival
